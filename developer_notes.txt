All of this is based off of my previous Screener, buyingAlgorithm, and sellingAlgorithm repositories(private).
This program is designed to do everything in the previous programs but all in one program
This version is able to screen stocks, buy them in Alpaca API.

Important things:
-Needs to check if stock is already owned before buying
-Needs to be tested during trading hours to see if sellLib works and that everything works together seamlessly
-Needs to have a way to run constantly in the background during trading hours
