All of this is based off of my previous Screener, buyingAlgorithm, and sellingAlgorithm repositories(private).
This program is designed to do everything in the previous programs but all in one program
This version is able to screen stocks, buy them in Alpaca API. It is also able to get the current positions from the API and determine if it wants to sell any of them

This version now implements timeControl.py in order to run constantly and detect when the market opens and closes.
This version now stores attributes for a faster run time.

Important things:
-Needs to detect weekends and market holidays
-sellLib not working correctly


Long Term Goals:
-Get more attributes for comparison to make a more accurate algorithm
