Now has implemented scraper program that works separately in order to improve run time. Attributes library and storage is mostly working.

Needs:
-The sellLib is broken and needs to be fixed. I need to figure out a way to link the tickers
from the api to Stock objects and give them their attributes from the attributes library.
