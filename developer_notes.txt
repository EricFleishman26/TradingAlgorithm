Now has implemented scraper program that works separately in order to improve run time. Attributes library and storage is working.
sellLib is now working correctly. Also detects weekdays from weekends in timeControl.

Needs:
- Cloud solution to run permanently but not on my machine
- Review of algorithm (possible tweaking)
- Continue testing corner cases and finding bugs
